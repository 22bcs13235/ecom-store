This project integrates Stripe Checkout using a Stripe test Secret Key (sk_test_...) to display a checkout list and handle payments. To get started, obtain your test key from the Stripe Dashboard and set it as STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in your environment variables. The backend uses this key to create Checkout Sessions and process test payments. You can use test card numbers like 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any valid future date, CVC, and ZIP. This setup is intended for development onlyâ€”do not use real card details.
